Construct an integrated environmental monitoring system in C, covering a range of fundamental concepts and practical applications. The project involves interacting with a free API that provides real-time environmental data. The system's core functionalities include data retrieval, processing, analysis, and reporting. The project has been created on Linux OS and the main program will run on a shell script on Linux’s terminal. It is designed to display the visibility of a certain location on an hourly basis and send an alert if the visibility of the location goes below a certain value. The program will generate a report at the end of the day.
